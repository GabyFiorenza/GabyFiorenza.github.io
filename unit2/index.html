<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>

<p>I really appreciate the design work that <a href=http://thelocalpalate.com/> The Local Palate</a> and <a href=https://review.oysterbooks.com/> The Oyster Review</a> have. Both sites inspire me with their use of focal point, flow and general user expereince.</p>

<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>

<p>The Local Palate site effectively uses size to draw the user's eye to the enlarged focal point image of the index page. The elements bar at the top is visually appealing by seperating the logo in black and site pages in white. This design directly flows into the focal point image below, which copies this seperation by showing an asymetrical slice of bread next to a symetrical package. There is also an intentional overlap of the site's enlarged header and feature story's slightly smaller header onto the focal point image. This leads the user's eye down while also creating a hierarchy within the subsequent articles.

The Oyster Review site also effectively uses size to draw the user's eye to the focal point image of the index page. The site also beautifully utilize the white space to frame the focal point and subsequent elements, which helps to distinguish a clear hierarchy. The varying sizes of visual elements below, compliment the focal point well to create a solid visual balance. </p>

<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>

<p>Both website make great use of size by having large visual focal points on either index page's and subsequently smaller visual elements below creating a hierarchy of content.

The difference between either site is the lack of white space in The Local Palate compared to The Oyster Review's use of white space to create seperation and hierarchy. There is more balance of shape and size in The Oyster Review compared to The Local Palate, which instead chooses a strong focal point with overlapping text to create a hierarchy and flow downwards to additional content.</p>


<h2>Thumbnail sketches</h2>

<ul>
<li> <strong>Index Page</strong></li>
<img src="Index Page.jpg" alt="Index Page" height="20%" width="20%">

<p>I was inspired by another website that similarly used a focal point on their index page, however making it more complex by having 3/4 of the page vertically taken up by the image. For my index page, I hope to make this image an actual slideshow of artwork slowly sliding periodically. There is a visual balance here between the focal point and the minimal white space where the additional page links will be. </p>
<br>
<li><strong>About</strong> </li>
<img src="About Page.jpg" alt="About Page" height="20%" width="20%">

<p>In keeping with the theme, this page will also start off with a large focal point at the very top of the page, however positioned this time at the top 1/3 of the page. The white space below the focal point creates the hierarchy and draws the users eye down to the two smaller self portraits below. I want to play around with shape and size with these two self portraits. Next to the portraits will be a small blob of dark text written on top of the white space.</p>
<br>
<li><strong>Portfolio</strong></li>
<img src="Portfolio Page.jpg" alt="Portfolio Page" height="20%" width="20%">

<p>Once again there is a large focal point positioned at the top 1/3 of the page, which will be greyed out until the pointer moves over it, illuminating the color and creating a portal back to the index page. This focal point creates a natural hierarchy to the smaller images organized below. These images will be showcasing various artworks and be ever changing. Since these images are meant to highlight specific works of art, I hope to also include a feature bar that will grey over the image when scrolled over, to reveal the title, medium used and short description.</p>
<br>
<li><strong>Contact</strong></li>
<img src="Contact Page.jpg" alt="Contact Page" height="20%" width="20%">

<p>There will be a large focal point at the top of the page. Since I want the contact page to be very simple, I want to use the negative/positive space to create a vertical balance within 
acting as seperation of information. This theme is carried from the focal point, which creates the hierarchy with its use of positive space.</p>
