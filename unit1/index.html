<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I'm a Production Assistant living in Boston, MA. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I want to learn how to create my own website in order to sell my artwork and to also become generally more tech savvy.</p>

<h2>My Mission</h2>

<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a Web Designer for an art magazine or architecture company because I aim to work in a creative, design-driven and innovative atmosphere.</p>
