<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>

<p>I really appreciate the design work that <a href=http://thelocalpalate.com/> The Local Palate</a> and <a href=https://review.oysterbooks.com/> The Oyster Review</a> have. Both sites inspire me with their use of focal point, flow and general user expereince.</p>

<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>

<p>The Local Palate site effectively uses size to draw the user's eye to the enlarged focal point image of the index page. The elements bar at the top is visually appealing by seperating the logo in black and site pages in white. This design directly flows into the focal point image below, which copies this seperation by showing an asymetrical slice of bread next to a symetrical package. There is also an intentional overlap of the site's enlarged header and feature story's slightly smaller header onto the focal point image. This leads the user's eye down while also creating a hierarchy within the subsequent articles.

The Oyster Review site also effectively uses size to draw the user's eye to the focal point image of the index page. The site also beautifully utilize the white space to frame the focal point and subsequent elements, which helps to distinguish a clear hierarchy. The varying sizes of visual elements below, compliment the focal point well to create a solid visual balance. </p>

<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>

<p>Both website make great use of size by having large visual focal points on either index page's and subsequently smaller visual elements below creating a hierarchy of content.

The difference between either site is the lack of white space in The Local Palate compared to The Oyster Review's use of white space to create seperation and hierarchy. There is more balance of shape and size in The Oyster Review compared to The Local Palate, which instead chooses a strong focal point with overlapping text to create a hierarchy and flow downwards to additional content.</p>


<h2>Thumbnail sketches</h2>

<ul>
<li> <strong>Index Page</strong></li>
<img src="Index Page.jpg" alt="Index Page" height="500" width="300">

<p>Demonstrates focal point through large visual image on right. Image will be a slideshow of artwork slowly sliding to change image periodically. The use of space creates a natural hierarchy of the elements bar on left, which balances the focal point with negative space.</p>
<br>
<li><strong>About</strong> </li>
<img src="About Page.jpg" alt="About Page" height="500" width="300">

<p>Another large visual focal point above, will most likely be a stagnant image that is greyed out until the pointer moves over it, illuminating the color and creating a portal back to the index page. The visual balance and  hierarchy given by the large focal point, draws the users eye down to the two smaller self portraits shown. These will be next to a small paragraph of text.</p>
<br>
<li><strong>Portfolio</strong></li>
<img src="Portfolio Page.jpg" alt="Portfolio Page" height="500" width="300">

<p>Once again there is a large visual focal point above, which will be a stagnant image that is greyed out until the pointer moves over it, illuminating the color and creating a portal back to the index page. This focal point creates a visual balance and hierarchy to the smaller images organized below. These images will all be of various artwork. The smaller images with be mostly picture with title and medium info written below it in a block of white space.</p>
<br>
<li><strong>Contact</strong></li>
<img src="Contact Page.jpg" alt="Contact Page" height="500" width="300">

<p>Once again there is a large visual focal point above, which will be a stagnant image that is greyed out until the pointer moves over it, illuminating the color and creating a portal back to the index page. This page is meant to be uber simplistic with a thin line seperating the title header and actual contact information. There is a symetrical balance between the white space and line seperating header and info.</p>
